  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop using software carpentry materials will introduce you to the fundamentals of Python, including data types, conditional statements, loops and functions. The goal is to teach the practical knowledge needed to start programming, debugging and using Python in everyday tasks.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
